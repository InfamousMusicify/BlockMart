Vanilla Item Shop (no plugins or scoreboards needed)

  I have Created a Vanilla Command Block Item shop. (Java Edition)
And i saved it as a structure block for anyone who is playing vanilla and is looking for an alternative to plugins for an item shop.
Or just for people looking to supplement a play-through.


I also advise loading up the world file in single player and messing with the shop yourself a bit.


To put the Structure into your World/Server,
Navigate to the minecraft/saves folder or your server world file,
and paste the .nbt file into the world/generated/minecraft/structures folder.
hop into the world and pull out a structure block.


There is a world file included for editing or testing purposes.

I hope the shop serves you well, I spent an entire night making it.  and like a month messing around with it before that.
