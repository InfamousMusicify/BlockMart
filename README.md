### Vanilla Item Shop   
#### (no plugins or mods needed)   
  __I have Created a Vanilla Command Block Item shop. (Java Edition)  
And I saved it as a structure block for anyone who is playing vanilla and is looking for an alternative to plugins for an item shop.  
Or just for people looking to supplement a play-through.  
I have also added a datapack to the mix which is optional.  Pay other players / check balance and top balances!__

~~I also advise loading up the world file in single player and messing with the shop yourself a bit.~~  

-    `Click Codeâ–¼ - Download ZIP - Extract Zip file`   
To put the Structure into your World/Server,  
Navigate to the minecraft/saves folder or your server world file and paste the "`blockmart-3.x(.x).nbt`" file into the  
`world/generated/minecraft/structures` folder. (if this does not exist create the needed folders)  
`/reload` after pasting if the world is running  
Hop into the world and pull out a structure block, and put "`blockmart-3.x(.x)`" (structure file name) into a `load` structure block.  
__!!!`Remember to load with entities on`!!!__  
  
~~There is a world file included for editing or testing purposes.~~

I hope the shop serves you well, I spent a long time building this and then rebuilt it twice.  
~~I spent an entire night making it.  and like a month messing around with it before that.~~

### Seeking team members:
__If you believe you are technically skilled and are interested in helping with the project,  
Programmers and Player Testers are needed!  
The scale of this project is beyond one persons time/ability.  Even a small team could spend weeks working on this.  The original shop was built over time.  
3.0 is being rebuilt from scratch with the skeleton of the old shops code, but adding over 400 items with a return trade for each is a massive undertaking.   
If you have the ability to write commands and organize the different sections of minecraft items into a coherent buy and sell walls, please get involved in this project.  Any help is appreciated!__  

### [Donations appreciated:ðŸ”—](https://www.patreon.com/InfamousMusicify) 
__All of my projects take an inordinant amount of time to upkeep/create.  
I use my free time to make them.  Any support would be much appreciated!  
If you enjoy these packs and want to see more like them and see them maintained, send me some love!__  

     Cheers
